This repository contains the tasks and mini-projects I completed during my Artificial Intelligence Internship at CodeSentinel
.
The goal of these projects is to strengthen my foundations in Python, APIs, File Handling, Web Scraping, and CLI apps.

Special thanks to CodeSentinel for providing this internship opportunity and helping me strengthen my programming skills.
